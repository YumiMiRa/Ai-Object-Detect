This script uses OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model to perform real-time object detection through a webcam. Here's a brief explanation of the key components:

1. **Classes and Colors**: The `CLASSES` list contains the names of the object categories that the model can detect. `COLORS` generates random colors to use when drawing bounding boxes around detected objects.

2. **Model Loading**: 
    - The `net` variable loads the pre-trained MobileNet SSD model using the provided `.prototxt` and `.caffemodel` files. 
    - The `.prototxt` file defines the model architecture, while the `.caffemodel` file contains the pre-trained weights.

3. **Video Capture**: 
    - The `cap` variable initializes the webcam for video capture.
    - Inside the `while True` loop, the script continuously reads frames from the webcam.

4. **Blob Creation and Object Detection**: 
    - The frame is resized and normalized into a "blob" that the model can process.
    - The blob is then passed through the network to obtain detections.

5. **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: 
    - For each detection, the script checks if the confidence score is greater than 0.5 (50%).
    - It then calculates the coordinates of the bounding box, draws it on the frame, and adds a label with the object's class and confidence score.

6. **Display and Exit**: 
    - The processed frame is displayed in a window.
    - Pressing the 'q' key exits the loop, releases the webcam, and closes the window.

### Improvements or Modifications:
- **Adjust Confidence Threshold**: You can change `if percent > 0.5:` to another threshold if needed.
- **Frame Size**: Resize the frame to improve performance on slower systems or improve accuracy with larger frames.
- **Save Output**: Add functionality to save the output video or frames.
